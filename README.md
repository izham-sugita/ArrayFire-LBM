This project demonstrate the simple use of ArrayFire library to implement the lattice Boltzmann
method (LBM) for two-dimensional heat equation. The codes are written for simplicity sake. 
No effort was made to improve speed and efficiency. The codes should serve as a simple example for
LBM implementation on GPU using ArrayFire.
